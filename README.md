# Here are the accompanying code samples and slides for my MongoDB Days UK talk 2015 on "Building Operational Data Pipelines with Python and MongoDB".

The files are organised as follows:
 - ./airflow/example_dags/*.py which are the examples of using Monary and PyMongo within Airbnb's Airflow workflow scheduler, just copy these to the same directory "example_dags" in your local Airflow setup
 - ./code these are the Python examples covered in the talk
 - ./datasets these are the various data sets used in the talk
